Now that we know how to generate content dynamically we have to take fully advantage of the dynamic content generated by third-parties.

A [mashup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mashup_(web_application_hybrid)),  is a web application, that uses content from more than one source to create a single new service displayed in a single graphical interface. 

Representational state transfer (REST) or [RESTful web services](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) are a way of providing interoperability between computer systems on the Internet. REST-compliant Web services allow requesting systems to access and manipulate textual representations of Web resources using a uniform and predefined set of stateless operations. 

Via REST, we can integrate web resources from heterogeneous provider to meshup our solution.

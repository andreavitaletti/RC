In many cases, resources can be accessed only to authenticated users. This is exactly the purpose of [oAuth](https://oauth.net/), an open protocol to allow secure authorization in a simple and standard method from web, mobile and desktop applications.

[OAuth 2](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/an-introduction-to-oauth-2) is an authorization framework that enables applications to obtain limited access to user accounts on an HTTP service, such as Facebook, GitHub, and DigitalOcean.

[Passport](http://www.passportjs.org/) is authentication middleware for Node.js. It allows to easily implement oAuth for a number of providers, such as google, twitter and facebook, and also provides a simple mechanism for local authentication.
